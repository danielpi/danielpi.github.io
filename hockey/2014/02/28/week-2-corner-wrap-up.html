			<h2>Week 2 Corner wrap up</h2>
			<p class="meta">28 Feb 2014</p>
			<div class="post">
				<p>Good effort this week. Here is the conversion funnel. Notice that it is flatter than the previous week</p>
<img src="/assets/week-2-corner-conversion-funnel.png" alt="Week 1 Conversion Funnel" height="360" width="640" />
<h3>Last Weeks flicks</h3>
<video src="/assets/Week-2-Successful-Corners.m4v" width="640" height="360" controls></video>
<p>Some really good corners in that set. Hawley's flicks into the top right were a big improvement from last year and his accuracy on low shots was very good.</p>
<p>A couple of points to think about as you watch the video above</p>
<ul>
	<li>It takes a lot longer to get a shot away when the trap bobbles (obvious I know). The delay is long enough to make the difference between the runner getting to the top or not. I think we should have a backup pass to R1 if the trap and layoff are delayed.</li>
	<li>Hawley, sometimes you do the shot in one motion from the layoff and sometimes you touch the ball once and then take the shot. Again that delay will cost goals. This is the sort of thing we need to practice to perfection.</li>
	<li>I'm also a little worried that the shot is being taken too far inside the circle. Just comparing it to some other video on the web it looks like we need the shot to be closer to the top of the circle.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Trial match</h3>
<p>You can only see anything in this video if you blow it up to fullscreen on a computer</p>
<video src="/assets/trial-corner-commercial-1.m4v" width="640" height="360" controls></video>
<p>It was unfortunate that the trap bobbled and that the runner blocked the flick. More practice will mean that we get our shots away more frequently as the season continues. Some areas that we can improve though are</p>
<ul>
	<li>We should have had somebody at L2. We want 4 people dedicated to pouncing on the rebound. 2 from either side.</li>
	<li>Josh, I think you should be wider (though it is hard to tell in the video), you never looked like you were going to be receiving the ball and once the shot has been taken you should be trying to get in towards the keeper to pick up any scraps.</li>
	<li>Sam, You also need to get in towards the keeper after the shot has been taken. You need to get in front of the first runner so that they can't clear the ball.</li>
	<li>Hawley, after you regathered the blocked ball you took two shots that were pretty low percentage. At the time Shulz, Neumann and Haydyn (I think) were in good positions for a pass.</li>
	<li>Ian, The R1 position really needs to get in and mix it with the second runner. The second runners main job is to clear rebounds from the center of the circle and R1s job is to stop them</li>
</ul>
<p>Some more positive notes were</p>
<ul>
	<li>Neumann and Haydyn get into good positions off either post. Haydyn in particular does well to slot infront of the postie</li>
	<li>Hawley regathered the ball twice. That is all extra pressure on the defence</li>
</ul>
<p>The above is reading a lot into a single corner. However I think it is clear that there is plenty of low hanging fruit that we can pick to quickly improve our corner battery. There is also a bunch of areas where a long steady improvement over the course of the season will allow us to really build a great offensive corner battery.</p>
