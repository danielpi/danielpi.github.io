			<h2>Labrador Notes</h2>
			<p class="meta">10 Apr 2014</p>
			<div class="post">
				<h1>Some videos of interest of Labrador</h1>

<p>These first two videos are from the Uni vs Labrador game from last weekend. They highlight the massive difference in the levels of commitment by the two sides defensive players.</p>

<h4>Labrador Defence</h4>
<p>Uni hit into the circle, the ball is intercepted. However the clearance takes too long and Uni regain the ball. They then work to the back line with Labrador showing little urgency and the pass across the face is eventually knocked in for a goal.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Once the steal is made there is plenty of time for several of the Labrador players to react and cover the unmarked forwards. They are all slow to react though.</li>
	<li>As the Uni player gets to the backline there are three Labrador players that are in a position to apply pressure. The closest can't be bothered, the next closest stays upright and attempts to intercept on his backstick and the third hurries out of the way of a potential shot.</li>
	<li>Any of those three could have shut this play down by reacting quickly, staying low to the ground, moving such that the pass had to go down their forstick and by advancing on the player with the ball.</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="player0"></div></p>

<h4>Uni Defence</h4>
<p>Labrador break quickly and work into a goal scoring position. The ball is saved off the line by the Uni fullback.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Plenty of urgency from the Uni players. They are getting back faster than the Labrador support is getting into position</li>
	<li>The Uni fullback that saves the ball off the line shows great desperation for a side that is 2-0 up. In the lead up he cut the line to his player whilst forcing the man with the ball to have to pass.</li>
	<li>With the ball then in behind the defence he could easily have sat back and watched the keeper do his best. There is no reason to think that Labrador could be stopped from scoring.</li>
	<li>But he sprints back, dives from the wrong side of the attacker and makes a backstick save off the line.</li>
	<li>Kieran Powyers isn't considered to be a star player. But he made a difference in this game because he refused to give up.</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="player1"></div></p>


<h4>Labrador Corners</h4>

<p>layoff to L1. Shot goes high to the glove side and is saved. The clearance is stopped by the first flicker who has time to hit a shot and score</p>
<ul>
	<li>Labrador use the layoff to Harro a lot. Sometimes he is even wider than he is in this corner.</li>
	<li>Pretty poor defence from Uni after the initial save. The second runner is not ready for the rebound even though the keeper has deliberately tried to bring the ball down for him. The guy on the post jumps straight out of the net as soon as Gildea starts swinging. Josh if you are in that position you need to stay in the goal (ducking is allowed).</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="player2"></div></p>

<p>Labrador run a lot of variations. Harro has historically been the main target. He can pop up on the left or right, at the top of the circle or in front of goal for a deflection.</p>

<p><div id="player3"></div></p>
<p><div id="player4"></div></p>

<p>Seeing as how Harro is supposedly not playing much this year I'd assume that their other players are going to take a bigger role in the corner battery. They have a couple of guys that can hit and a couple that can flick. They looked very disorganised against Uni last week but they will be a different side down on the coast. They kept Easts to 2-1 in week 2.</p>
