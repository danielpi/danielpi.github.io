			<h2>Attacking Corners against Bulimba</h2>
			<p class="meta">06 Apr 2014</p>

				<h1>Videos of our corners against Bulimba</h1>

<p>Please excuse the titles of the videos, They are not correct. They are displayed on this page in order though. The video quality is not great either. They are best viewed at full screen size and at a high resolution.</p>

<p>This first corner came in the first half. The bunt was mis-directed and they eventually cleared the ball but I was realy happy with this corner. The factors I was pleased about were</p>
<ul>
	<li>When the bunt went astray nobody paniced. Sam regathered and looked for an open player finding Nick.</li>
	<li>Nick, when faced with two players trying to tackle him also didn't panic and was aware enough to know where Jenno was likely to be.</li>
	<li>Jenno, had gotten into a position where he could block the stick side postie from making an intercept. He then got a decent shot away that required a good save from the keeper.</li>
</ul>
<p> There is always room for improvement though and this clip highlights that we need to be more aware of our options in front of goal. Have a look at the far post when Jenno has his shot. Aaron is wide open.

<p>In this corner the shot from L1 gets run down. What happened here? Does the first or second runner get the block? Does Nick need to stand wider or were we just a little slow with the pushout, trap or bunt?</p>

<p>High flick from the top of the circle goes in after getting a touch from the keeper. This is a good example of the mantra "Get the shot on goal and see what happens". Here Hawley has thrown a hard flick to an area that Eds didn't think he could aim at. It wasn't going in the roof but it was quick enough and deceptive enough that it got through. </p>

<p>Back to basics for Hawley. Shooting low and scoring. It didn't need to be just inside the post, splitting the keeper and postie from what I can tell. This is a reward for all that hard work practicing flicks before training that you have done this year and last Hawley, Well Done.</p>
